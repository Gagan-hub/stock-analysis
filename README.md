# Stock-Analysis
Green Energy stock Analysis using VBA

## Overview of Project

The main objective of this project is to explore the green energy stock's performance by analyzing financial data by using VBA code. We have the data of 12 stocks for the year 2017 and 2018. The original code for this analysis take more run time, so I have to refactor the code and increase the efficiency of the original code.

# Summary 
## Pros and Cons of Refactoring Code
The main benefit of refactoring is that it helps make our code cleaner and more organized. Therefore, after refactoring code will be more efficient and faster.  The main disadvantages is that it is time consuming as well as we might messup the code.

## The Advantages and disadvantage of Refactoring Stock Analysis
The main benefit of Refactoring Stock Analysis is an decrease in macro run time. The original analysis took over one second to run, whereas our new analysis only took about 0.7 second to run. Attached above are the screenshots that indicate the run time for our new analysis. I didnot see any disadvantage of doing refactoring on this code.
